### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- The `Configuration` class is now instantiated through a builder DSL ([#13](https://github.com/nesk/akkurate/issues/13))

- Add constraints to validate additional JVM types: `LocalDate`, `Duration` and `Period` ([#7](https://github.com/nesk/akkurate/issues/7))

## [0.3.0] - 2023-10-16

### ⚠️ Breaking changes

- Validation accessors are generated only for public properties. ([#11](https://github.com/nesk/akkurate/issues/11) [#15](https://github.com/nesk/akkurate/issues/15))
- Accessors are now generated for the properties of the implemented interface when possible, not for the implementation. ([#11](https://github.com/nesk/akkurate/issues/11))

### Added

- Provide built-in accessors for `kotlin` and `kotlin.collections` packages ([#11](https://github.com/nesk/akkurate/issues/11))
